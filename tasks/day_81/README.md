Day 81 Goals: what you will make by the end of the day

Welcome to Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s! Imagine you're working for a real estate development company. Your company wants to value any residential project before they start. You are tasked with building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:

The number of rooms

The distance to employment centres

How rich or poor the area is

How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc



Today you will:

Analyse and explore the Boston house price data

Split your data for training and testing

Run a Multivariable Regression

Evaluate how your model's coefficients and residuals

Use data transformation to improve your model performance

Use your model to estimate a property price
