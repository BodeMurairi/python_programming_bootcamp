Day 80 Goals: what you will make by the end of the day
Your Story

Today you will become a doctor, but not just any doctor. You will become Dr Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 who worked in the Vienna General Hospital.


In the past, people didn't know about bacteria, germs, or viruses. People illness was caused by "bad air" or evil spirits. But in the 1800s Doctors started looking more at anatomy, doing autopsies and making arguments based on data. Dr Semmelweis suspected that something was going wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital. Dr Semmelweis wanted to figure out why so many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever (i.e., puerperal fever).
